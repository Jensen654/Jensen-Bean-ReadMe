# About Me
My name is Jensen Bean, I am a Full Stack Web Developer from West Jordan UT. I just completed a course at TripleTen where I gained experience in creating both frontends and backends to websites and deploying those sites to google servers and github pages. I have always been interested in problem solving and logic problems, and I'm so glad I found my niche here. I love the work I've done and I love how challenging and complex it can be. I also have creative endeavours. I have been involved in many theatrical productions over the past couple years and I love to perform. I play multiple instruments and sing as well.

Developed, researched, and designed solely by me. This was my final undertaking as a part of my school. I worked with a third party api (PokeApi), and implemented some basic user recognition via browser cookies. It has been optimized for all screen sizes. Built with React, Vite, JS, HTML/CSS, JSX and more.

# Full Stack Weather Clothing App
[Live Site via Netlify, Render.com, and MongoDB Atlas](https://whimsical-kangaroo-a94316.netlify.app/)

Developed using a figma design as well as a design document provided by TripleTen, this project taught me how to fully develop and deploy a website from the ground up. It incorporates secure data transfer and encryption, storing user data on a remote server with a fully functioning api interface. It was built using express, node.js, MongoDB, React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, JSX, Mongoose, and more. I deployed it to google servers using a free trial. I learned how to build and maintain a server. Browser Routes are only accessible via user authentication on both the front and back ends of the project.
